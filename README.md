# Dutch Energy System Dynamics Models

This repository contains sketches for a high-level energy system design for the Netherlands. It contains a currated dataset for the most important parameters of the system. The system itself is build using Julias [AlgebraicJulia](https://github.com/AlgebraicJuliai), a category theoretic library for  scientific computing.
